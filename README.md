# My_Resume_App
Stage 2 task for HNG9

## App Description
The App is build on Kotlin for native android phones and the app is just a one-page digital resume containing very little details about but meets all the requirement for stage 2 task.
Which is not a reflection of my abilities.

## Codebase Description
The One Page Activity Resume contains just the activity_main.xml layout file and the MainActivity.kt file.

### activity_main.xml
The root layout is a Constraint layout with a vertical orientation. Followed by cardview for the image and various textview. 
Then, we have the imagebutton for the social media links which are clickable.
We also have the textView that contains Professional summary, and various services that I offer and tools that i use to achieve them.
The final component on the theme button that allows you to choose between dark mode or light mode.

The app is so plain so but if I had more time I would have loved to implement the language selection and also customize the UI better.
